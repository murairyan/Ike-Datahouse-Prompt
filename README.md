# Ike-Datahouse-Prompt
My answer to the prompt given by Ike Datahouse.

// Building the Solution:
I decided to use C++ as my choice of language for this prompt. The main issue, however, of using C++ was that I could not create and use an array that would accept both int and string values as suggested in the JSON input and output from the prompt. So, as a countermeasure to go around this issue I decided to use a 2-D array. Reason for this is because I know that there are three team members and three applicants, and each of these "objects" contain 3 int values (originally four, but for simplicity I decided to do three). Therefore a 2-D array with three rows and columns works accordingly to the input given. The biggest flaw to this design was that it would be difficult to assess who was who according to the score, but since this is almost like pseudo code I just designed it as a developer would in C++. I would imagine that there would be another array to store the names of the team members and applicants to correspond to their respective scores. After delving into working around the nstring and int array issue, I decided to go with several functions that would help dictate the scoring of the team members and applicants. At first I tried to understand how the scoring system worked based on the input and output given to me by the prompt, but to no avail. So, I had went for a simple solution of adding the vlaues of all the socres of the team and then taking the avergae of it.
